What you described is a **workplace violence / threat** concern, and it should be treated as emergency.\n\nIf you believe there is any immediate risk:\n1) **Get to a safe location** and contact onsite security or local emergency services right away.\n2) **Alert a supervisor or security team immediately** (ideally not the person involved). If you’re remote, contact your building/security contact or HR’s emergency line.\n3) **Preserve evidence**: keep the threatening message, voicemail, email, or screenshots. Note dates, times, and any witnesses.\n4) **Request interim measures**: no-contact instructions, badge access review, changes to schedules or work location, and support for a safety plan.\n\nEven if the threat feels “not serious,” patterns (angry statements, fixation, stalking, bringing weapons into conversation) are important to report—security professionals assess these signals.\n\nYou shouldn’t have to evaluate this alone. A confidential report to HR/security can start an assessment quickly, and retaliation for raising safety concerns is not allowed.\n\nAre you safe right now? If yes, we can talk about the fastest way to reach security/HR at your workplace; if not, please prioritize emergency help.",

Based on what you shared, this raises a workplace concern and it deserves to be handled through the right workplace channels rather than you having to manage it alone.\n\nA few immediate steps that can help:\n1) **Document and preserve details**: write down dates/times, what was said or done (as close to exact wording as you can), who was present, and keep any messages, screenshots, or calendar invites.\n2) **Choose a reporting path that feels safe**: you can contact HR, your company’s ethics/compliance hotline, or a designated manager outside the reporting line. If the person involved is senior or in your chain of command, an anonymous hotline or compliance route can reduce pressure.\n3) **Ask about confidentiality and next steps**: HR/compliance can explain who will know, how an inquiry works, and what interim protections (schedule changes, reporting line changes, no-contact instructions) may be available.\n\nIt’s also important to know that **retaliation for raising concerns in good faith is prohibited** under company policy and often under law. If you notice negative changes after speaking up—sudden write-ups, exclusion, shift changes—document those too.\n\nIf you feel your safety is at risk right now, prioritize getting to a safe place and contact onsite security or local emergency services.
